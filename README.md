# KPYC (Kanti Python Compiler) 

KPYC is a small compiler supporting a subset of Python. This includes basic features like variables, functions, conditionals and loops.

It is written in Haskell.

Executables built with the compiler run on the linux platform. The compiler depends on nasm (Netwide Assembler) and ld (GNU linker).

To build the project you need cabal or you can just use the prebuilt binary in /builds.

This is a school project.
